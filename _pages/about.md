Hello!

My name is Terrell, and this will serve as my personal website. Here is where
I will host any cool projects I take part in, post about various things that
come to my mind, and where you will be able to learn a bit about what I am
involved in/am passionate about.

At the moment, this website is a **work in progress** so I apologize for the
appearance. In the meantime, feel free to check out my LinkedIn page, my other
social media accounts, or email me for more information!
