To start this series and this blog, I want to speak on a relatively simple idea
that has shaped my view on the service that I do since around 2013. This idea is
based on the belief that a good volunteer knows how to make the best of their
situation.

This thought reentered my mind as Facebook showed me posts about friends of mine
volunteering for the New York City MS Climb to the Top event, hosted by the
National Multiple Sclerosis Society at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. It brought back
memories of my volunteering at the very same event back in 2014 alongside other
members of the Bronx High School of Science’s Key Club (and not just the “leg
day” that resulted from me personally having to help clear all 60+ flights of
stairs at the end). The club’s time at this event is a pretty good example of
what I mean by making the best of a situation.
